A quiz game for Android and IOS made in flutter

I have written this in flutter, for the sole reason that you can develop both for Android and IOS as the same time,
whilst only having to maintain a single codebase. 

----
## left of:
    Search bar duplicates search results for some reason. 

## Todo:

    Sonner than later:

        Multiplayer backened - using nodeJS
            - Move fetchOpenGames() into Database class.

            - Create game 
                - Open new Lobby class until someone joins (currently just updates server with new game, but doesn't change view)

            - Join feature 
            - Small chat (all multiplayer games should have a chat to roast each other duuh)
            - Start game

        Responsiveness (smaller screens might get a pixel overflow)
            - design should also work in protait mode
            - set resizeToAvoidBottomPadding: false on most Scaffold widgets

        DeathMatch
            - make a design in AdobeXD

     later:
        - REMOVE debug printouts
        - Make a Contants file
        - let users make a custom avatar
        - settings tabs when everything else works

        - debug
        - debug
        - AND more debugging.

        - Realease by 30. april.
